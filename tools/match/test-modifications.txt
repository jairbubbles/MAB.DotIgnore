The tests are taken from:

https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/t/t3070-wildmatch.sh

We then strip off the C functions so we're just left with the test lines.

All tests which span two lines using '\' are then moved onto a single line.

The test expectations are as follows:

match 0 0 0 0 path pattern

The first pair of numbers are the expected results with glob matching 
enabled (case sensitive and insensitive respectively), and the second pair 
are the expected results with glob matching disabled (GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS=1).

wildmatch returns zero for a match, so the expected result will be 0 if the
test should pass or 1 if it should fail (with a few exceptions where it is
expected to throw an error).

GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS is the default, and as the whole point of this library is
to match using wildcards, we can just ignore the second result pair for now.
