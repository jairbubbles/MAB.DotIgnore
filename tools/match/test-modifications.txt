The tests are taken from:

https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/t/t3070-wildmatch.sh

We then strip off the C functions so we're just left with the test lines.

The git test expectations are formatted as follows:

match 0 0 0 0 path pattern

The four numbers are the test expectations. The expected result will be 1 
if the pattern should match the specified path and 0 if it should not.

The first pair of numbers are the expected results with glob matching 
enabled (case sensitive and insensitive respectively), and the second pair 
are the expected results with glob matching disabled (GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS=1).

GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS is the default, and as the whole point of this library is
to match using wildcards, we can just ignore the second result pair for now.

Five of the tests span two lines (using '\'), and have eight expected results 
instead of four. These are cases where the match result differs depending on 
whether or not the match function is called by the git-ls-files command.

This commit details the exact cases:
https://github.com/git/git/commit/de8bada2bf63d274b8f7759f0ffd0b7669e52eca

Currently we just remove the extra four git-ls cases, as the goal for this 
library is only to replicate the wildmatch behaviour, not that of every code 
path in git.
